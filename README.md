# CLI Expense Tracker (Rust)

A command-line application written in Rust to track personal income and expenses.  
The goal of this project is to practice core Rust concepts such as ownership, borrowing, enums, traits, error handling, and modules â€” while ending up with a useful tool.

---

## Features (Planned)

- Add income and expense transactions  
- List all transactions  
- Track category totals (e.g. food, rent, salary)  
- Save and load data from a file  
- Generate basic reports (balance, category breakdown, filters)  
- Modular design with structs, enums, and `impl` blocks
